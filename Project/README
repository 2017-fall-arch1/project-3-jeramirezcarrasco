This little game is played by pressing the button S1 when the moving block is in a color space, after a while the game
will get faster and new color spaces will appear but if you miss the color space or after some time pases the scor will decrease.
Button S4 can be use to cheat, which adds points whith out the need to play, but just dont go pressing it too fast
Button S3 will lower the score

The way the game works is that it keep track of the position of the moving block and times the press of the button S1 with the possition
if some condition is met then the score increases
